# OOP_Design_Project_1.2

Creating 2 different programs here. First of all, I am going to make a tool which performs statistical analysis of a given numerical array.
Because I am new to Object Oriented Programming, I am using these projects to familiarize myself both with Java and that paradigm. 

The second project will have a tool which creates sorted palindromic strings from console input.
